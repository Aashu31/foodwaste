        <h1>Food Waste and its Management</h1>
        <p>Food waste is a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. Let's explore the causes, impact, and
methods of managing food waste to save the planet from the brink of destruction. Join us in the fight against
food waste!</p>

        <h2 style="background-color:white;">The Definition of Food Waste</h2>
        <p style="background-color:white;">Food waste is the loss of edible food that was intended for human consumption. This includes food that has been thrown away or left to spoil. The scale of food waste is staggering, with millions of tonnes discarded every year.</p>
		<div class="grid-container">

					<p>Food that never reaches the consumer due to issues like storage, transportation and distribution is known as food loss. It happens mostly in developing countries or those with poor infrastructure.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.6Iohf_c1IDRz9Dy0RM4qPAHaE6?w=253&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7"width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Food Waste</span><br>
					<p>It refers to that part of the food that has been produced and will not be consumed by anyone, whether it's in the restaurant,home or supply chains, and thrown away. It  generally happens in rich countries due to high standards of living and dietary habits.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.tEhod8US7gQaIkSOazvOrgHaHa?w=167&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7')"width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Food Surplus</span><br>
					<p>This occurs when more food is produced than needed or there is an abundance of a particular crop. Surplus crops go to waste because there are no buyers e.g. ugly or overproduced veggies never make it to the supermarket because they fail to meet cosmetic standards, which leads to waste.</p></div>

		<h2 style="background-color:white;">Importance of Managing Food Waste</h2>
		<p style="background-color:white;">Food waste is a global issue. Not only does it pollute the environment but also wastes resources and deprives people of food and essentials. To combat this urgent problem, we need to work together towards sustainable solutions.</p>

		<div class="grid-container">
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.dibTPEo7oeJIjYMTnFt-ogHaDV?w=281&h=157&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Environmental Impact</span><br>
					<p>Food waste is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which accelerate climate change and other environmental problems. By reducing food waste, we can help minimise these impacts.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.xzSGkvcnVsa93KqrLD2bggAAAA?w=221&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Economic Impact</span><br>
					<p>Keeping food waste in check means lower disposal costs, less expenditure on packaging and storage, and increased profits for businesses. Moreover, It creates new job opportunities in fields like food recovery and composting.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.KYBjzkgeL79K1RZiBEmUwAHaD4?w=314&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Social Impact</span><br>
					<p>Food waste deprives many people of their basic needs. By redistributing food to those who need it, we can help address food insecurity that affects millions around the world.</p></div>

		<h2 style="background-color:white;">Causes of Food Waste</h2>
		<p style="background-color:white;">Food waste occurs at every stage of the food supply chain. While there are many causes of food waste, some factors contribute more than others. Let's explore some of the most significant causes of food waste.</p>

		<div class="grid-container">
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP._C3XOgANOukbEgWlyFcYnwHaFx?w=222&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Overproduction</span><br>
				<p>Producers grow more than needed due to market demands or as an insurance policy against bad weather or pests. When there is no downstream demand, this results in waste.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP._bKiPoKcf_lOiVd_XoOxlgHaE7?w=262&h=187&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Expiry</span><br>
				<p>Many foods are discarded before they expire due to food safety laws, best before labels, or better-off food regulations, leading to unnecessary waste.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP._q1X8IKNEYC7aBsy5ZRcNQHaJQ?w=134&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Consumer Behaviour</span><br>
				<p>Consumers often purchase food they never eat or throw away edible food due to poor meal planning, confusing expiration dates, or over-preparation for events</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Mp6s7CZMWBDo3eitbG7nZwHaGt?w=201&h=182&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br><span class="span">Retail and Supply Chain Practices</span><br>
				<p>Retailers and supply chains reject products in packaging that is damaged or fails to meet aesthetic standards, which leads to waste of consumable food.</p></div>

		<h2 style="background-color:white;">Methods of Food Waste Management</h2>
		<p style="background-color:white;">To manage food waste effectively, a range of methods is used, often depending on the type of food waste generated. Some of these methods are discussed below.</p>

		<div class="grid-container">
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.bIaJK8lzAX1jKfnmkSbypgHaDQ?w=334&h=153&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Composting and Anaerobic Digestion</span><br>
					<p>Composting is an eco-friendly way of breaking down food waste into nutrient-rich fertilisers, which can be used in gardening. Anaerobic digestion processes organic waste in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas, a renewable fuel.</p></div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.P5br6EP7UCBSG85IYl9yuwHaDt?w=317&h=175&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Redistribution and Donation</span><br>
					<p>Organisations can redistribute and donate food waste to those who need it. This not only minimises food waste but also helps to combat food insecurity around the world.</p>
                </div>
			<div><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.9OWKYT1K6AVXpH969VnsYwHaEw?w=250&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7" width="250" height="200"><br>
				<span class="span">Prevention Strategies</span><br>
					<p>Prevention strategies such as meal planning, composting, and portion control are effective in reducing food waste. Moreover, Incentivising supermarkets or restaurants that produce zero food waste can also create a positive impact.</p></div>
